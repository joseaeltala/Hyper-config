    "readme": "# read-cmd-shim\n\nFigure out what a [`cmd-shim`](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/cmd-shim)\nis pointing at.  This acts as the equivalent of\n[`fs.readlink`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readlink_path_callback).\n\n### Usage\n\n```\nvar readCmdShim = require('read-cmd-shim')\n\nreadCmdShim('/path/to/shim.cmd', function (er, destination) {\n  â€¦\n})\n\nvar destination = readCmdShim.sync('/path/to/shim.cmd')\n```\n\n### readCmdShim(path, callback)\n\nReads the `cmd-shim` located at `path` and calls back with the _relative_\npath that the shim points at. Consider this as roughly the equivalent of\n`fs.readlink`.\n\nThis can read both `.cmd` style that are run by the Windows Command Prompt\nand Powershell, and the kind without any extension that are used by Cygwin.\n\nThis can return errors that `fs.readFile` returns, except that they'll\ninclude a stack trace from where `readCmdShim` was called.  Plus it can\nreturn a special `ENOTASHIM` exception, when it can't find a cmd-shim in the\nfile referenced by `path`.  This should only happen if you pass in a\nnon-command shim.\n\n\n### readCmdShim.sync(path)\n\nSame as above but synchronous. Errors are thrown.\n",
